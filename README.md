Ideas for coding projects

*I'm thinking we could probably try both web design and application design. Maybe both, make a website or edit a currently existing one and add a Java applet that's relevent the site. That'll allow the utilization of both, and anyone who is interested in one or the other could get their feed wet with Java, scripting languages, or mark up languages. 

~First, we should probably just open up issues in the issue tracker for ideas. That way we can easily close issues/ideas if we don't like them and reserve this space for accepted ideas. I think setting up a website with a java web framework would be a good idea. Seem's like Spring MVC is the dominant framwork for java. Looks like Grails is pretty popular as well, but that uses Groovy (still compiles to java bytecode but is an extra learning step). Personally, if we were going to stray from java, I'd prefer to use python/django as our framework because I'm learning that anyways.

I'm going to copy this to an issue over on the issue tracker then delete this when you reply so that we can keep the readme open for accepted projects.
